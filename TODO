Tasks:
  ☐ I2C read/write @low
    ☐ utility command
    ☐ read/write EEPROM
    ☐ NVRAM
  ☐ 68010+ startup should put vector address in VTOR @high
  ☐ pack / decompress at startup for small ROMs?
  ☐ CP/M BIOS? Generic BIOS?
  
  selftest commands:
    ☐ exception generator
    ☐ disk exerciser
    ☐ memory exerciser

Things to fix:
  ☐ NatFeat detection relies on writing to (vbr), no good if vectors are in ROM...
  ☐ scan selftest is failing @high
    scan 'test  a 1234 0x789 0xabcDE' -> -1, a 0 0x0000 0x00000000
  ☐ CB030 CompactFlash registers are probably wrong

Nice to have:
  ☐ disassembly format

Tests:
  ☐ verify that p90mb s-record upload works (vector save area size is zero)
